// Const

// Const works just like let, except you CANNOT change
// the value

// NOT ALLOWED!

const hens = 4;
hens = 20; //ERROR!

const age = 17;
age = age + 1; //ERROR!

// Why use const?

const pi = 3.14159;
const daysInWeek = 7;
const minHeightForRide = 60;

// Once we cover Arrays & Objects, we'll see other
// situations where const makes sens over let.

const feetInMile = 5280;

// Var

// The old variables keyword
// Before let & const, var was the only way of declaring
// variables. These days there isn't really a reason to use it.

var runDIstance = 26.2;

// There are really no good reasons to use var before let or const.
