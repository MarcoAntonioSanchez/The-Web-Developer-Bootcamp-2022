// First constants exercise:

// Let's get some practice defining constants.
// Please define the following two variables:

// 1. Define a constant called "boilingPointC" and set it to 100.
const boilingPointC = 100;

// 2. Define a second constant called "boilingPointF" and set it to 212.
const boilingPointF = 212;
