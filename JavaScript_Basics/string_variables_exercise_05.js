//Our First String Variables Practice
// Please define the following string variables (you can use either let or const):

// 1. The variable bestColor should be set to the string purple (the best color on planet earth, as we all know);

let bestColor = "purple";

// 2. Variable quote should be set to the string You had me at "hello" - be careful about quotation marks, we want double quotes inside the string.

let quote = 'You had me at "hello"';
