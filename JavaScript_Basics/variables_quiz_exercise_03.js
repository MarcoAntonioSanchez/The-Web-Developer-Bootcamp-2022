// Variables quiz:

// Question 1:
// What is the value of score after the following code runs?

let score = 5;
score + 4;

// Answer: 5.
// Because: The variable "score" is not updated so it won't add
// the 4 number to the initial 5.

// Question 2:
// What is the value of bankBalance after the following code runs:

let bankBalance = 100;
bankBalance /= 2;
bankBalance += 10;

// Answer: 60.
// Because: First we initialize the variable "bankBalance" on 100.
// Then we devide it by 2, this give us 50 as result.
// For last we do the addition and update on the variable with
// a 10 over the 50 that we have first, total: 60.

// Question 3:
// What is the value of age after the following code runs?

const age = 64;
age++;

// Answer: 64.
// Because: It is a constant called "age" so we can't update
// the value so it remains in 64.
