// Variables quiz:

// Question 1:
// Which one of the following variables contains a valid boolean:

// let isHappy = 'true';
// let isHappy = True;
let isHappy = true;

// Answer: the 3rd one.
// Because: The 2st one is a string and the second one has the
// uppercase first letter so the correct one is "true".

// Question 2:
// Which one of the following variable declarations follows JavaScript variable naming conventions?

// let high_score = 107;
// let high-score = 107;
// let HighScore = 107;
let highScore = 107;

// Answer: the last one.
// Because: None of the first three are cammel notation as the
// good practice's recommends.
