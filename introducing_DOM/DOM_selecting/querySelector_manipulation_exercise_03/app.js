// Pickles Exercise
// I've provided you with some basic markup in index.html

// Please use JavaScript to select the <span> element that currently reads "Delicious"
// Change its text to read "Disgusting" USING JAVASCRIPT. Even if you are a weirdo who likes pickles, please change the text to "Disgusting".

// YOUR CODE GOES HERE:
document.querySelector("span").innerText = "Disgusting";
