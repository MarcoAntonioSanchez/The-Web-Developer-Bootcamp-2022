// Functions
// Reusable procedures

// - Functions allow us to write reusable, modular code
// - We define a "chunk" of code that we can then execute at a later point
// - We use them all the time

// The goal will be to write down something like this:
let die2 = rollDie();

// To do something like this, every time without having to
// re-writed
let die1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
